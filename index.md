## Hello!

I am Hendra Manudinata, usually called as Hendra. I am a teenager from Bali, Indonesia who is interested in program code.

## Me and code

I started to love code since I'm in fourth grade of Elementary School. In that day I was making a simple script for tweaking Android performance. Ah really good old days, tweaking old Android 4.2 device to run games smoothly.

Fast-forward to sixth grade, I was learning how to build kernel, especially Android. But in that day I was really dumb. Using x86-64 toolchain in Android proot-ed Linux system. Wasting so much internet packages. But "experience is the best teacher" right?

Fast-forward again to seventh grade in Junior High School, finally I can built Android kernel, and made my own custom kernel for Samsung Galaxy J4. Using CI. Why? I don't have PC (yes I have, a laptop. But the spec is very horrible). Was popular by the way.

Fast-forward to now, eigth grade. Making some random scripts and custom kernel/recovery/ROM for some devices. I learnt much in those days. Cool.
